# CSPArduino
Arduino Labs for CSP

Start by forking this repo into your own github account.
Then download the files onto your computer.

Instructions for the individual labs are included in the comments. More detailed instructions can be found in the slide decks distributed through Google Clasroom.

When you complete a lab, upload the completed file (into the correct folder) back into github.  Create an appropriate commit message then commit the changes with the green button.

Finally create a pull request. This will tell me that you have completed the assignment and would like me to grade it.  I will be able to see diffs in the code that you completed compared to the starter code that I gave you.

Be sure to update the header block, include insightful comments and format your code properly so that it is easily readable.
